Stock prediction has been one of the most intricate learning problems in the statistics and Machine Learning space.

Stock prediction has been one of the most intricate
learning problems in the statictics and Machine Learning space.
This is because there is no one single best way to do it
and the factors affecting stock prices cannot be determined
with a good confidence. Any unforeseen situation could have
affected the stock prices of a company and modeling datasets
with variables that cannot be fathomed, is indeed what makes
Stock prediction difficult. In this work, we attempt to model
a dataset of stock prices of Microsoft, augmented with some
common features important for stock prices, such as Inflation
rate, unemployment rate and the Gross Domestic Product, in
an attempt to perform stock price prediction post a 28 day
period. We compare classification models that model the dataset
to classify an investment decision for a given day as a profit or
loss, and regression models that predict the returns, post a 28
day (20 working day) period. The models are compared mutually
and the best one of them is used for the calculation of the income
returned if the model is used as the basis for investment.
